# othello
This AI version of Othello allows a person to play the game Othello (aka Reversi).  The AI takes advantage of a good heuristic and depth 5 minimax search.

This AI code was created starting with the base code for the game which is available at the website https://inventwithpython.com/reversi.py .  The base code with a changed colorful display is also available in this repository.
